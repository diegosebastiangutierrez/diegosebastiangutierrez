<h1 align="center">Hi üëã, I'm Diego Gutierrez</h1>
<h2 align="center">A passionate PHP/Drupal Developer from Argentina</h2>
</hgroup>

<h3>Presentation letter: A Little about what i am looking for...</h3>

Hello! My name is Diego Gutierrez, i am from Argentina starting a new life in Mexico. I am looking for an opportunity of working with cool people that contribute to my personal growth through conjunct collaboration and feedback. Many say that i am not the typical "nerd" stereotype that programmers represent... i am extroverted and i am not worried about not knowing something right away, but with a couple pointers i can get to the same level as seniors do. 
I am not gonna lie to you, i am a little rusty... i moved to Drupal 8 and 9 but was too comfortable with hooks, and now i am pretty lost with the symphony layer, but with a little help i can start working faster and more efficiently in about two, three weeks. I love Javascript and CSS, i like my frontend compliant and responsive (fast in response and mobile first).
I also have knelwdge of administering AWS for media streaming websites all over Argentina (more than 50 in a year, for 7 years) and i love infrastructure. Obviously, i quit MS Windows like 9 years ago, LINUX RULES!! and as a developer it makes everything faster... and cheaper! OPENSOURCE HAS SAVED MY B**T SOOO MANY TIMES! It's amazing to read someone else's code and find a great idea to try and optimize.
So, yes, even if they don't say so, i am a total nerd. I even created my own portal which has more than 7 thousand users a month (that come back as google shows us) and 68% comes from organic search and most of our readers are from all over the world).
You can see my site which obviously is a Drupal 9, on a little VPS on Amazon. 

https://ouroboros.world

I would love critique's and opinions! No matter how hard they can be, kill me for knowledge!

Oh yeah, it is a short introduction, started very professional and finishing as if we were friends. I am social, what can i do about it :D ? 

I have to mention that right now i have been doing drupal 7 to 9 migrations about for 5 months and i love that kind of challenge.

Please, let me know if we can grow together.

<h2>Experience and Previous Jobs</h2>

## Profile

I started working in the field of computer science when I was **15 years old**, first teaching introductory classes to children, helping them with their first steps in computing, using educational software, and teaching basic Windows skills to elderly people who did not want to be left out of the technological world.

This was around the year 1994, then I left high school at 18, and continued working for a small printing company (1998) making invoice designs and other business documentation.

A year later, I got a better job in a company called **Making the Future**, working there for almost 4 years (1999 - 2003).

I worked for them carrying out Consulting, repair and maintenance of equipment, Network Administration and cable layout. Later I began to enter the world of programming, hand in hand with the ASP language, since the company outsourced programming services to another friendly company, without giving any revenue, for which I decided to take the reins of development in the company. I started loving FLASH in its first versions, I also worked with the first versions of DreamWeaver, databases on the web with ASP and IIS.

In the technical section, I worked with some of the most important clients of the company, among them:

1.  CELS (Center for Legal and Social Studies)
2.  EITAR SAIC
3.  Bag√≥

**CELS (Center for Legal and Social Studies)** :  
Argentine Human Rights Association, 2 years of OnSite technical service for Windows platforms (1999 - 2001).

**EITAR SAIC** :  
Manufacture of security equipment for gas appliances, 2 years of OnSite service, managing Windows Networks, maintenance and prevention on Windows clients (60 computers in charge), a Linux Mail Server. NT Database / File / Print Servers and much more 2 times a week (1999 - 2001).

**Bag√≥** :  
For them, I created a Web based system for the documentation of pharmacological formulas, called **Dossier Manager** (2000).

Later he would start working for a government entity, here in Buenos Aires **CONEAU** , responsible for the National University system. There i was in charge of Technical Service and maintenance tasks for Clients and Servers (more than 90 teams in charge) between 2004 and 2005.

After that period, things got a bit aggitated and I started working as a Freelancer, until I got a position as a Drupal developer at **CMD - Grupo Clarin**, from 2010 to 2012, constantly developing in PHP5, Drupal 7, HTML5, CSS3, MYSQL.

Development of Applications for Samsung and LG Smart TVs, Websites for VOD and a Set-top-box with web interface.  
The **Qubit.tv** and **Personal Video application** for the Samsung Smart TV platform were made entirely by me.  
The Set Top Box was a project where we were able to create a device capable of booting a complete linux embedded system, with a web interface through Midori, which was modified to be able to communicate with a WebSocket Server developed by us, which allowed the interface to communicate with the low-level processes of the video accelerator board to handle decoding and streaming through the Qubit App.  
The device allowed converting a non-smart TV into a smart with playback capability, generating apps, it had a complete API to communicate with the kernel from html5, and it also allowed any smartphone to be used within the same network as a remote control ( or several) and in the case of using a game, to be able to transform the cell phone / tablet into a joystick.
